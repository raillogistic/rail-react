# Rail Django Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **Rail Django**, a production-ready GraphQL framework for Django.

Rail Django wraps [Graphene-Django](https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/) to provide a battery-included experience with automatic schema generation, enhanced security, and enterprise-grade features.
